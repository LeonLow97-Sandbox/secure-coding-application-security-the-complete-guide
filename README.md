# Introduction to Application Security

### Software Developmnt Life Cycle (SDLC)

### SDLC - Designing

- Describe features and operations
    - Screen layout
    - Business rules
    - Process diagrams
    - Pseudo code and documentation
- Prototype work
- Detailed design
    - Technology choices
    - System architecture

### Definition of Security

- Security is anything you do to protect an asset that is vulnerable to some attack, failure or error.
- An asset is anything you deem to have value.
    - holds value, produces value or provides access to value.
- Vulnerability is any weakness in an asset that makes it susceptible to attack or failure.
- An attack is any intentional action that can reduce the value of an asset. E.g., DDOS attack on web server or data center.
- Failures and errors are unintentional actions that can reduce the value of an asset. (power failure causing outrage to server)

- Steps:
    - Determining what assets we want to protect
    - Learn how the  asset works and interact with other things
    - Determine how our asset's value is reduced directly and indirectly.
    - Take steps to mitigate the threats.
